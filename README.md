## Developer info
- You need to have node.js installed to run the application with a local node.js server. I currently (02/18) use v8.0.0 and v6.11.2 and it works fine
with both versions.

After you cloned the repo from github you should run `npm install` to install all node dependencies into your local working directory

### Run the app locally
Run the application by entering `npm start` in the terminal

### Build the application
Build the application by entering `npm run build` into the command line. Build means that a file named `Component-preload.js` is created 
which helps loading the application faster.
